* Personal Guix System
*What is Guix?* Go and [[https://guix.gnu.org/][read it]].

With this, you can clone this repo and have my exact* setup up and running.
/Not exactly/, the .config folder is still not defined here.

** TODO List
- [X] Set up initial configuration
- [ ] Migrate .config to within guix.
- [ ] Implement org-babel.
