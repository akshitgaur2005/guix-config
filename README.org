#+title: Akshit Gaur's Gory Guix Config
#+author: Akshit Gaur

* Welcome to my Guix Config

**What is Guix?** Go and [[https://guix.gnu.org/ ][read]] it.

With this, you can clone my repo and have the exact* same system up and running as me.
 /Not exactly/, the
 #+begin-src bash
 .config
 #+end_src
 is still not defined here, will do it someday.

** TODO list
        - [x] Create basic guix config
        - [] Port .config to it too.
